# Aotearoa Road Trip - Christmas Tool 2021

Come along with us in this RStudio Meetup where we take a tour through the design and development of our 2021 Christmas Shiny App - the Aotearoa Road Trip!
 
We start off with a short history of Epi-interactive's Christmas Tools, followed by a demonstration of the 2021 Edition of the Christmas Tool and a discussion about its design and concept. Then we go under the hood into the Shiny / JavaScript code backend which makes it run, such as Shiny modularisation, Leaflet for R and Leaflet JS extensions such as MovingMarker, and some Shiny tricks we picked up along the way.
